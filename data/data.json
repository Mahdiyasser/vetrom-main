It loads user information from a central JSON data file and presents it in a visually appealing grid of \"author cards.\" Each card displays a user's name, ID, and profile picture, and functions as a direct link to their private media space. The portal is styled using Tailwind CSS and includes a client-side function for toggling between light and dark modes based on user preference.\r\n\r\nThe Administration Panel: This is the secure command center of the system, requiring a simple password for access. Administrators have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) control over user accounts. This includes creating new users, editing their profiles, and safely deleting users and all their associated files and directories. The panel offers a high-level dashboard displaying system-wide metrics, such as the total number of users, current aggregate storage usage, and the overall system storage limit (e.g., 5 GB). Furthermore, the admin can inspect and manage any individual user's media collection directly, with the ability to delete specific files after viewing them.\r\n\r\nThe Personalized User Space (CMS): Each user has a dedicated, personalized content management area. The primary function here is media uploading and management. The system enforces a strict per-user storage limit (e.g., 250 MB), displaying warnings and blocking new uploads if the limit is reached or if the file exceeds the remaining capacity. Media is automatically categorized into sections for Images, Videos, and Audio. The interface includes advanced client-side tools for efficient collection management, featuring:\r\n\r\nSearch functionality to filter files by name.\r\n\r\nSorting options by name, size, or date modified.\r\n\r\nFiltering by upload date.\r\n\r\nBulk deletion of selected items.\r\n\r\nA full-screen modal for viewing media.

Passwords are stored securely as SHA-256 hashes (though the cleartext and Base64 versions are also stored in the logs\/accounts for administrative purposes). All login attempts are meticulously logged.",
        "story": "Detailed Breakdown of the Login System\r\nThe login system is primarily contained within the include.php file, which is designed to be included at the beginning of any protected page. This structure enforces authentication and authorization before rendering the main page content.\r\n\r\n1. Configuration and Data Storage\r\nThe system relies on four JSON files to store all persistent data:\r\n\r\naccounts.json: Stores user profiles, including user-name, user-password-sha256 (the secure hash), user-password-base64 (the Base64-encoded cleartext password), a list of user-premissions (paths the user can access), and the last-log timestamp.\r\n\r\nsessions.json: Stores active login sessions for single-device enforcement, containing the user-name, a unique session-cookie, and the session-expiration time.\r\n\r\nlogs.json and full-logs.json: Store detailed and simplified records of all login attempts.\r\n\r\n2. Login Process (process_login function in include.php)\r\nThe login process is executed upon a POST request containing a username and password:\r\n\r\nRate Limiting\/Cool-Down: Before authentication, the system checks the server-side $_SESSION['failed_attempts']. If the user has exceeded MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS (3) within COOL_DOWN_MINUTES (15), the login is immediately blocked, and the user is informed of the remaining cool-down time.\r\n\r\nAuthentication: The entered password is converted to a SHA-256 hash and compared against the stored hash in accounts.json.\r\n\r\nPage Permission Check: If authentication succeeds, the is_page_allowed function checks the user's permissions array against the current page's URI. It supports exact path matching and wildcard permissions (e.g., \/admin\/*).\r\n\r\nSingle Device Enforcement: If the user is successfully authenticated and authorized:\r\n\r\nAny existing session for that user in sessions.json is deleted. This effectively logs out the user on any other device.\r\n\r\nA new session record with a unique session-cookie and a 1-hour expiration is added to sessions.json.\r\n\r\nThe server-side $_SESSION is set with the user's login data.\r\n\r\nLogging: A successful-login event is logged to both logs.json and full-logs.json. For security, full-logs.json also captures the Base64-encoded client IP address and the full session cookie.\r\n\r\nFailed Attempts: If login fails (wrong credentials or access denied), the $_SESSION['failed_attempts'] counter is incremented, and a failed-login event is logged. The entered password is Base64-encoded before being logged in full-logs.json and logs.json.\r\n\r\n3. Session Validation and Authorization Check\r\nOn every page load, include.php performs a session check:\r\n\r\nServer-Side Check: It confirms the existence of the $_SESSION['is_logged_in'] flag.\r\n\r\nSession Cookie Validation: It searches sessions.json for a matching user-name and session-cookie. If a match is not found (due to expiration or being logged in elsewhere), the session is cleared, and an appropriate error is displayed.\r\n\r\nPage-Level Authorization: It re-checks the user's permissions for the current page (is_page_allowed).\r\n\r\nEnforcement: If the user is not valid, authorized, or their session is expired\/deleted, the script stops (exit()) and includes login.php to display the login form.\r\n\r\n4. Admin Panel (index.php)\r\nThe index.php file implements a basic Admin Panel for managing the login system's data.\r\n\r\nAdmin Authentication: The panel has a simple, non-hashed password login defined by the ADMIN_PASSWORD constant.\r\n\r\nCRUD Operations: It provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for accounts.json (render_accounts_crud):\r\n\r\nCreate: Adds a new user, automatically hashing the password with SHA-256.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Allows changing a user's permissions or setting a new password (which is then re-hashed).\r\n\r\nDelete: Removes a user account.\r\n\r\nSession Management: The render_sessions_crud allows an admin to manually end an active session by deleting its entry from sessions.json.\r\n\r\nLogging: The render_logs function displays the content of full-logs.json, separating successful and failed logins and showing all tracked data points, including IP addresses, usernames, and passwords (stored in the logs as Base64-encoded cleartext).\r\n\r\nDashboard: The render_dashboard provides metrics on total users, log events, active sessions, and a list of recent user activity."
